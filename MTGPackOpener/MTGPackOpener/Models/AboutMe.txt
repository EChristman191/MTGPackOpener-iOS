Accessibility
We designed our color palette with accessibility first, validating contrast ratios to meet WCAG AA standards for text and key UI elements. This ensures legibility for users with low vision or color-vision differences without sacrificing theme. We balanced our MTG-inspired hues with sufficient contrast and tested common states (default, hover, disabled) to keep the interface both readable and immersive. The result is a look that feels on-brand and pleasant while remaining inclusive.
