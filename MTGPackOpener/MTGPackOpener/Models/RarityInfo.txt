Description
Magic: The Gathering (MTG) cards are printed with different **rarities** that represent how often they appear in packs and how powerful or collectible they tend to be. Each rarity is associated with a **distinct color** to make it easy to recognize at a glance.


Common — Gray

  Common cards are the most frequently printed cards in a set. They provide the foundation for many decks and usually represent straightforward spells, creatures, and mechanics.
- **In Gameplay:**
  Commons are reliable but often less flashy. They ensure consistency and accessibility for all players.


Uncommon — Blue / Silver

  Uncommons are less frequent than commons and often showcase more specialized effects or slightly stronger creatures.
- **In Gameplay:**
  These cards can introduce new strategies and synergies that are less likely to be found in common slots.


Rare — Gold

  Rare cards appear only once every several packs. They often include powerful spells, game-changing creatures, or unique mechanics.
- **In Gameplay:**
  Rares frequently serve as the “centerpieces” of decks and can define strategies.


Mythic Rare — Orange / Red-Orange

  Introduced in 2008, Mythic Rares are even scarcer than rares. They usually highlight iconic characters, planeswalkers, or cards with dramatic effects.
- **In Gameplay:**
  These cards are designed to feel special — often splashy, powerful, or story-driven.


Legendary / Special Printings (optional tier) — Purple

  While not an official rarity tier in standard MTG packs, many special or promotional cards (like premium foils or exclusive printings) are presented with a unique feel. Purple is often used as a thematic choice to represent mysticism or exclusivity.


Summary

These rarity colors don’t affect gameplay rules directly, but they strongly influence **collectability, deckbuilding, and the excitement of opening a pack**.
