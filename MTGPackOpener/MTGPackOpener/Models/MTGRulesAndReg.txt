Magic: The Gathering — The Basics

Magic: The Gathering is a collectible card game where two or more players compete as powerful spellcasters (Planeswalkers). Each player has a deck of cards and attempts to reduce their opponent’s life total to zero using creatures, spells, and strategies.

Core Concepts

**Deck & Cards**
  A player’s deck typically contains at least 60 cards (in most formats). Cards include **creatures, spells, enchantments, artifacts, lands**, and more.

**Mana & Casting**
  To cast spells, players must pay **mana**—the resource generated by **lands**. Each spell has a mana cost, indicating how much and which color of mana is required.

**Phases of a Turn**
  Each player’s turn is divided into multiple phases:
  1. **Beginning phase** (Untap, Upkeep, Draw)
  2. **First Main Phase** (play a land, cast spells)
  3. **Combat Phase** (attack, block)
  4. **Second Main Phase** (similar to first)
  5. **End Phase / Cleanup**

**Combat**
  During the Combat Phase, you declare attackers, the opposing player may declare blockers, and then damage is assigned. Creatures with damage equal to or exceeding their toughness are destroyed.

**Victory Conditions**
  You win by reducing your opponent’s life total to 0, or by other card-specific effects. You can also lose if you must draw from an empty deck in most formats.

**Rarity & Collectibility**
  Cards come in **rarities** (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Mythic, etc.). Rarity affects how often a card appears in packs, but not necessarily how powerful it is. Rarity is often marked with a symbol and even color-coded in certain UI/hobby settings.

Summary

These rarity colors don’t affect gameplay rules directly, but they strongly influence **collectability, deckbuilding, and the excitement of opening a pack**.
